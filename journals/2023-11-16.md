## NEURAL NETWORK

network made by perceptron

a perceptron is a node of the network it process signals input represented by a real number

the mapping between input and output of the perceptron is represented trough mathematical function 

## NON LINEAR FUNCTION AS PERCEPTRON FUNCTION

it's important that the function is non linear cause linearity does not shutdown noise adn maps it into the output cause:

`f( x1 + x2 ) = f( x1 ) + f( x2 )`


## FEED FORWARD MULTI-LAYER NETWORK

- input layer that weight the signals and feed an hidden layer

- hidden layer that maps inputs to outputs with a signal function
	number of node is a parameter of the network

- output layer show neural network outputs
	number of nodes depends on the number of classes in the domain
