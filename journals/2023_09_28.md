	- statistics 
	- machine learning
	- database systems
## DATAMINING VS MACHINE LEARNING

## DATA WAREHOUSE
- collection of data that supports decision making
- subject-oriented
- integrated and consistent (no delete or update, only add) (automated data collection process) 
- it show data evolution overtime
## MULTIDIMENSIONAL MODELS (OLAP)
- they organize data in a multidimensional structure where data are organized based on categories

## OLPT VS OLAP
- OLTP process data trough transactions
- OLAP analyze data trough queryes to retrive informations

## DATABASE VS DATA WAREHOUSE

## DATA MART
- subset of the data in the primary data wharehouse related to a specific category
- they are the **building block for DWH**
-  they are used to divide data in subset for compartimentalization
