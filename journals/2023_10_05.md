# OLAP
- allow users toc navigate the DWH interactively using chains of operators
## OPERATORS
- **roll-up**
	- adds aggregation to the data collection
	- ![](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020231005143104.png)
- **drill-down**
	- removes aggregation from the data collection
	- ![](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020231005143041.png)
- **slice-and-dice**
	- set a dimension to a specific value reducing the data collection dimensions
	- ![](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020231005143020.png) 
- **pivot**
	- change in layouts of the collection of the data
	- ![](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020231005143426.png)
- **drill-across**
	- create a liink between data co compare them
	- ![](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020231005143524.png)
-  **drill-through**

## EXTRACTION TRANSFORMATION AND LOADING (ETL)
- the process that extracts clean and integrate data to feed the DWH
### extraction
- **static**: DWH is populated for the first time
- **incremental**: the DWH is updated with new data regularly 
### CLEANSING
- procedure to improve de quality of the data removing duplicates and standard
### TRANSFORMATION
- procedure where data are transformed to adjust the format according to the schema
### DENORMALIZATION
- used on relational databases to aggregate the data

## ARCHITECTURES
- separation
- scalability
- extensibility
- security
- administrability
#### SIGLE-LAYER APPLICATION
- Its goal is to minimize the amount of data stored,
removing data redundancies.
• The source layer is the only layer physically available.
• DWH is implemented as a multidimensional view of
operational data created by specific middleware.

#### TWO-LAYER ARCHITECTURE

#### THREE-LAYER ARCHITECTURE


## DIMENSIONAL FACT MODEL (DFM)
