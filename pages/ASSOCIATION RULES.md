An expression of the form A (Antecedent) --> C (Consequent) , where A and C are itemsets.
### DEFINITIONS

- **ITEMSET**--> A collection of one or more items.
- **K-ITEMSET** --> An itemset that contains k items.
- **SUPPORT COUNT (Ïƒ)** --> Frequency of occurrence of an itemset.
- **SUPPORT** --> Fraction of transactions that contain an itemset.
- **FREQUENT ITEMSET** --> An itemset whose support is greater than or equal to a minsup threshold.

### RULE EVALUATION METRICS
-  **SUPPORT (sup)** -->Fraction of the N transactions that contain both A and C.
- **CONFIDENCE (conf)** --> Measures how often all the items in C appear in transactions that contain A.

Rules with low support can be generated by random associations, but rules with low confidence are not really reliable. Nevertheless a rule with relatively low support but high confidence can represent associations of less sold products, but often sold together.
**Rules with originated from the same itemset have the same support, but different confidence.**
### ASSOCIATION RULE MINING TASK

Given a set of transactions N, the goal of association rule mining is
to find all rules having
- $support >= minsup$ $threshold$
- $confidence >= minconf$ $threshold$ 
We can use a **brute-force approach**:
- List all possible association rules
- Compute the support and confidence for each rule
- Prune rules that fail the minsup and minconf thresholds, but that's **Computationally prohibitive**!
Therefore, we use a **two-step approach**:
1) **FREQUENT ITEMSET GENERATION** --> Generate all itemsets whose support is greater than minsup (computationally expensive)
2) **RULE GENERATION** --> Generate high confidence rules from each frequent itemset, where each rule is a binary partitioning of a frequent itemset
