## AGGREGATION

the process of combining 2 ore more attributes into a single one, this can be done to obtain differet goals:

- data reduction
- change of scale
- more stable data 

## [SCALING](SCALING.md)


## [SAMPLING](SAMPLING.md)

the process of reducing the dataset dimensions making samples
## [DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION](DIMENSIONALITY%20REDUCTION.md)

the process of reducing the number of features

## [FEATURE SUBSET SELECTION](FEATURE%20SUBSET%20SELECTION.md)

the process of selecting a subset of feature

## [LABEL ENCODING](LABEL%20ENCODING.md)
