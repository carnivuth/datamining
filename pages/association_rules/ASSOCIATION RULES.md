# ASSOCIATION RULES

They are rules that describes situation where the presence of a given element $\{A\}$ or a combination of elements $\{A,B\}$ assure the presence of a third element $\{C\}$, they are based on statistics.

## DEFINITIONS

- **ITEMSET**--> A collection of one or more items.
- **K-ITEMSET** --> An itemset that contains k items.
- **SUPPORT COUNT $\sigma$** --> Frequency of occurrence of an itemset.
- **SUPPORT** --> Fraction of transactions that contain an itemset.
- **FREQUENT ITEMSET** --> An itemset whose support is greater than or equal to a minsup threshold.

Association rules can be described by the form 

$$
A \rightarrow C \space where \space A,C \in itemset
$$

$A$ is called **antecedent** and $C$ is called **consequent**

## METRICS

### SUPPORT  $sup$

the fraction of transaction that contains both $A$ and $C$

$$
sup = \frac{(A,C)}{N}
$$

### CONFIDENCE $conf$

the number of times $C$ appears over transactions that contains $A$ 

$$
conf = \frac{(A,C)}{A}
$$

#### CONFIDENCE FROM SUPPORT

confidence can also be computed from supports as 

$$
conf = \frac{(A,C)}{A} =\frac{\frac{(A,C)}{N}}{\frac{A}{N}} = \frac{sup(A,C)}{sup(A)}  
$$


support measures "how much" an occurrence can be considered a rule (there must be enough transaction cases), a rule with low support can be generated by random associations

confidence measures how much a rule is represented in the transactions that contains it
