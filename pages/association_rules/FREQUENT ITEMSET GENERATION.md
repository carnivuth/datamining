Given D items, there are $M = 2^D$ possible candidate itemsets.

### BRUTE-FORCE APPROACH

The brute-force approach generates each itemset in the graph above. Then, it computes the *sup* and *conf* indexes values for every association rule generated by every itemset.
 - Complexity (**EXPENSIVE**): O(NWM), where
	 - N = total number of the transactions
	 - W = average number of items within a transaction
	 - M = number of freuent itemset candidate.

#### Frequent Itemset Generation Strategies
- Reduce the **number of candidates** M (Apriori Algorithm)
	- Complete Search: $M=2^D$
	- Use pruning techniques to reduce M
- Reduce the **number of comparisons** NM
	- Use efficient data structures to store the candidates or transactions
	- No need to match every candidate against every transaction
