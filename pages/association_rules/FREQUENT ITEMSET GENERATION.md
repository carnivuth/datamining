# FREQUENT ITEM-SET GENERATION

This step  aims to generate all possible  with a $sup \gt threshold$.

## BRUTE-FORCE APPROACH

For each possible item-set (called candidate) compute it's $sup$ by scanning the database.

This, approach which have a complexity of $\mathcal{o}(NMW)$ where:

- $N$ -> total number of the transactions
- $W$ -> average number of items within a transaction
- $M$ -> number of frequent item-set candidate.

it's extremely computational expensive. 

There are other strategies that aims to reduce the computational cost of this operation such as:

- reducing the number  of candidates by pruning ([apriori algorithm](APRIORI%20ALGORITHM.md))
- reducing the number of comparisons $NM$

### BRUTE-FORCE APPROACH

The brute-force approach generates each item-set in the graph above. Then, it computes the *sup* and *conf* indexes values for every association rule generated by every item-set.

#### Frequent item-set Generation Strategies
- Reduce the **number of candidates** M (Apriori Algorithm)
	- Complete Search: $M=2^D$
	- Use pruning techniques to reduce M
- Reduce the **number of comparisons** NM
	- Use efficient data structures to store the candidates or transactions
	- No need to match every candidate against every transaction
