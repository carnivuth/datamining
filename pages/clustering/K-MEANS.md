# K-MEANS

algorithm for finding the best clustering scheme

## PROCEDURE

- the number of cluster $k$ is an input of the user
- the algorithm chose $k$ random points as **temprary centers**
- it finds the nearest center and define the first **temprary clustering scheme**
- it computes the [centroid](CLUSTERING.md#CENTROID) of the cluster and repeats
