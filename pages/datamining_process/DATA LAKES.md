- it's a repository of data stored in raw format
- no schema on write requirements for the input sources to make easy the injection process
- to access data we follow a  schema on read approach for more versatility

## BENEFITS

- higher scalability (no need to scale large computing architectures)
- data are stored only in one place 
- support for unstructured data
- support for machine learning workloads

- this new systems are cheaper to design, can handle multiple data inputs, enabling users to perform powerful operations in a large amount of data of various forms

## DATA LAKES STRUCTURES

## DATA LAKE ARCHITECTURES

### lambda lake

- designed for multiple workloads 
- data are inserted in 2 pipelines one for time consuming operation (cold path) and one real-time workflows where data need to be sent to the clients faster 

![](Pasted%20image%2020231017165627.png)

### kappa lake

-  simplified version of lambda lake, it removes the cold path stage and replace it with a long term data storage

![](Pasted%20image%2020231017165903.png)

### delta lake

advanced features like:

- ACID properties (it is able to deal with consistency requirements).
- Scalable metadata handling.
- Data versioning (also called time travel, it allows the analysis of different snapshots).
- Unified batch and streaming source and sink.
- Schema enforcement and evolution.
- DBMS-like operations: updates, deletes, inserts, upserts (insert, on conflict update).
