-  Online analitical processing allow users to interactively navigate on the DWH 

- navigation is done trough chains of operators

## OLAP OPERATORS

### roll-up
	
- adds aggregation to the data collection

	- ![](Pasted%20image%2020231005143104.png)

### drill-down

- removes aggregation from the data collection

 ![](Pasted%20image%2020231005143041.png)
 
### slice-and-dice

- set a dimension to a specific value reducing the data collection dimensions

![](Pasted%20image%2020231005143020.png) 

### pivot
	
 - change in layouts of the collection of the data

 ![](Pasted%20image%2020231005143426.png)

### drill-across
	
 - create a liink between data co compare them

 ![](Pasted%20image%2020231005143524.png)

### drill-through
	
 - switches from the multidimensional data model into a operational data

## EXTRACTION TRANSFORMATION AND LOADING (ETL)

The **ETL** process aims to get data from sources, improve general data quality, transform data according to the schema and loads it in the DWH

C[TRASFORMATION\ndata processing according to the schema]
D[LOADING\nload data in the DWH]
A --> B
B --> C
C --> D
```

### EXTRACTION

The extraction phase aims to get data from the datasources, there are 2 possible approaches: **STATIC**  or **INCREMENTAL** 


```mermaid

flowchart TD
A[APPROACHES]
B[STATIC\nDWH is populated for the first time]
C[INCREMENTAL\nthe DWH is updated with new data regularly]
A --> B & C
```

Each approach is more suitable for certain types of data:

| types of data                                        | types of extraction                             |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| structured data (from databases or formatted files ) | static (for the first DWH population operation) |
| unstructured data (from social media)                | incremental (for the update operations on the DWH)| 

### CLEANSING

- data are processed to improve the quality, data are standardized and mistakes are corrected

#### SOLUTION FOR DATA INCONSISTENCIES

**Dictionary based techniques** 

- they make use of dictionaries and lookup tables to fix typing errors

**Aproximate merging**

- needed when merging data from different sources and there is no common key 

![](Pasted%20image%2020231008181831.png)
### TRANSFORMATION

- data are altered to match the information schema on the DWH

#### DENORMALIZATION
	
 - for relational database data are rearranged to reduce the number of queries to do on manipulation fase

### LOADING

#### REFRESH 

- the DWH is completely rewritten with new data
#### UPDATE

- only changes on source are applied to the DWH existent data are not canceled or modified
