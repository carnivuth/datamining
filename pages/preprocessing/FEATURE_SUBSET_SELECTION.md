# FEATURE SUBSET SELECTION

the process of selecting a subset of attributes from the dataset, it could be used to
- remove redundant attributes
- remove irrelevant attributes

## TYPES OF FEATURE SUBSET SELECTION

- ### BRUTE FORCE

	try all possible feature subsets as input to data mining algorithm and measure the effectiveness of the algorithm with the reduced dataset

- ### EMBEDDED APPROACH

	Feature selection occurs naturally as part of the data mining algorithm

- ### FILTER APPROACH

	Features are selected before data mining algorithm is run

- ### WRAPPER APPROACHES

	A data mining algorithm can choose the best set of attributes

here a possible architecture for feature subset selection:
